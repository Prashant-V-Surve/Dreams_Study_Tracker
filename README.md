# Dreams_Study_Tracker


Project Overview

The Dreams Study Tracker App is a console-based Java application designed to
help students systematically log, track, summarize, and export their study activities.

It allows users to maintain daily study records, view summaries grouped by date or
subject, and export all logs into a CSV file for offline reference.

This project demonstrates practical usage of Java Collections, File I/0, and Object-
Oriented Design in a real-world, utility-driven application.
