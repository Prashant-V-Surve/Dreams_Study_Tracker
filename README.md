# Dreams_Study_Tracker


Project Overview

The Dreams Study Tracker App is a console-based Java application designed to
help students systematically log, track, summarize, and export their study activities.

It allows users to maintain daily study records, view summaries grouped by date or

This project demonstrates practical usage of Java Collections, File I/0, and Object-
